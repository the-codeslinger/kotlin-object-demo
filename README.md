# kotlin-object-demo

Contains a few code snippets to show how Kotlin `object` can be used. For one there's the stumbling block that every Java programmer faces: where's my `static`? But there is more to `object` than just that.

For a more detailed explanation visit my blog. I've written two posts on this topic:

* [Kotlin Object Declarations – The fake-static](https://codeslingerhome.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/kotlin-object-declarations-the-fake-static/)
* [Kotlin Object Expression – What more can object do?](https://codeslingerhome.wordpress.com/2019/07/21/kotlin-object-expression-what-more-can-object-do/)
